# PomodoroTimer Application

## Application Proposal

This application allows the users to timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Users will be able to:
- *start* the timer
- *stop* the timer
- *reset* the timer 

This application will be used by **students** who need help not to procrastinate and be productive.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to start a 25 minute study duration
- As a user, I want to be able to pause the timer
- As a user, I want the 5 min break duration to start after the 25 minute study duration
- As a user, I want a star to be added once a study duration ends
- As a user, I want the correct messages to be displayed on the application
- As a user, I want an alarm to go off after each duration ends
